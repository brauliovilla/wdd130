        <p>Hello! My name is Braulio Villa and I am from Guayaquil, Ecuador. I enjoy listening to music, driving and learning about programming. I have served a mission in Arequipa-Peru and it was amazing. I am someone who likes to learn new things in my free time and apply them. I also like to exercise every day because it helps me stay prepared and alert for the day A few years ago I learned a little about programming and I remember that it was difficult since I didn't have the necessary tools to familiarize myself with programming, but I know that everything is difficult at first and requires effort, so now I'm trying to learn how to program and I know that with effort I can achieve it and I'm also open to any advice from others.. I'm here because I would like to increase my knowledge and one day be able to become a great software developer.</p>
