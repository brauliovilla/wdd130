        <p>Hello! My name is Braulio Villa and I am from Guayaquil, Ecuador. I enjoy listening to music, driving and learning about programming. I have served a mission in Arequipa-Peru and it was amazing. I am someone who likes to learn new things in my free time and apply them. I also like to exercise every day because it helps me stay prepared and alert for the day. I'm here because I would like to increase my knowledge and one day be able to become a great software developer.</p>
